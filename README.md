## Acknowledgements

I am very thankful to [Sebastin Santy](http://sebastinsanty.com/) for providing the awesome [template](https://github.com/SebastinSanty/minimal-research-theme). The original template was further modified by [Lakshay A Agrawal](https://github.com/LakshyAAAgrawal) and then [Ishaan Watts](https://wattsishaan.github.io/) whose source I obtained and modified to build my own website. I've also taken inspiration for few components from [Ashish Ashokan](https://ashishasokan.github.io/). Thanks to everyone!
