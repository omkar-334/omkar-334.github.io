	abstract = {The ruff sandpiper Calidris pugnax is a Palearctic lekking shorebird with three genetic morphs determined by an autosomal inversion. Male morphs differ strikingly in body size, ornaments, endocrinology and mating behavior. Aggressive Independents represent the ancestral haplotype, semi-cooperative Satellites and female-mimicking Faeders the inverted haplotypes. Since one inversion breakpoint is homozygous lethal, the inverted haplotypes (Satellite and Faeder) cannot recombine and are expected to accumulate mutations. The inversion regions also harbor genes involved in spermatogenesis. However, it is unknown whether the genetic difference between the morphs also translate into differences in sperm traits. Here, we use a captive-bred population of ruffs to compare sperm velocity and morphology among the morphs. Faeder sperm moved the slowest, which is in line with expectations from mutation accumulation and the idea that Faeders might fare worse than Satellites, as Satellite haplotype arose through a rare recombination event that may have re-instated the function of sperm-related genes or helped to purge deleterious mutations. Against the expectation from mutation accumulation, sperm of Independents did not seem to be of highest quality, i.e., they were not the fastest nor the least variable, and they had the shortest tail and midpiece. Although the midpiece contains the energy-producing mitochondria, sperm midpiece length was not associated with sperm swimming speed. Instead, two of three velocity metrics were weakly positively associated with head length (absolute and relative). These results may relate to our observation that although ruff sperm morphologically resemble those of passerines, they generally appear to move differently, vibrating from side to side while slowly moving forward, rather than rotating while moving forwards. To conclude, the three genetically determined morphs showed only minor differences in sperm traits, and these differences were not clearly associated with variation in sperm velocity, indicating a low potential for the evolution of morph-specific sperm adaptations.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},
